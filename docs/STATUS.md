# Implementation Status

Current state of Kapsel webhook reliability service.

## Complete

### Core Infrastructure

**Webhook Ingestion** - POST `/ingest/:endpoint_id` with HMAC validation, idempotency, 10MB limit, structured errors

**Data Persistence** - PostgreSQL with ACID compliance, connection pooling, `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` work distribution

**Delivery Engine** - Worker pool, HTTP client, exponential backoff with jitter (1s-512s), retry logic integration

**Circuit Breaker** - State machine (Closed/Open/Half-Open), failure rate calculation, per-endpoint isolation

**Merkle Attestation** - Leaf creation, batch processing, Ed25519 signing, tree construction via rs-merkle

**Test Infrastructure** - 292 tests across unit/integration/property/scenario/chaos layers, 80%+ coverage

## In Progress

**Attestation API** - Endpoints for STH retrieval, proof generation, client verification (implementation complete, API incomplete)

## Planned

**Management API** - Endpoint lifecycle, event status queries, tenant administration

**Performance Validation** - Benchmarks for 10K events/sec target, p99 latency measurement

**Production Operations** - Rate limiting, Prometheus metrics, OpenTelemetry tracing, health checks

## Technical Debt

None. Recent refactor eliminated all identified debt. See STYLE.md for standards.

## Test Coverage

| Layer       | Tests | Focus                                  |
| ----------- | ----- | -------------------------------------- |
| Unit        | 124   | Pure logic, no I/O                     |
| Integration | 90    | Component boundaries, real database    |
| Property    | 40    | Invariant validation                   |
| Scenario    | 30    | Multi-step workflows with time control |
| Chaos       | 3     | Failure injection                      |
| E2E         | 5     | Full system flows                      |

## Database Schema

**Implemented**: tenants, endpoints, webhook_events, delivery_attempts

**Attestation tables**: merkle_leaves, signed_tree_heads, proof_cache, attestation_keys

## Performance Targets

| Metric                  | Target         | Status                               |
| ----------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Ingestion latency (p99) | < 50ms         | Not measured                         |
| Delivery latency (p50)  | < 100ms        | Not measured                         |
| Throughput              | 10K events/sec | Architecture designed, not validated |
| Attestation batch       | < 100ms        | Implementation complete              |

## Next Priorities

1. Complete attestation API endpoints
2. Performance benchmarking
3. Management API implementation
4. Rate limiting and operational features
