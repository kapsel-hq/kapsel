# Kapsel Documentation

**The definitive webhook reliability service documentation**

Kapsel eliminates webhook failures through guaranteed at-least-once delivery with cryptographic proof. This documentation provides complete technical and operational specifications for building and maintaining the webhook reliability service.

## Core Documentation

## Document Philosophy

This documentation follows our engineering principles:

- **Vision First** - Every document reinforces the webhook reliability mission
- **Honesty** - Implementation status reflects reality, not aspirations
- **Completeness** - All technical decisions and trade-offs are documented
- **Actionability** - Clear next steps and implementation guidance

## Webhook Reliability Vision

Webhooks are critical infrastructure for modern applications. Payment processors, e-commerce platforms, and SaaS applications depend on webhooks for real-time integration. When webhooks fail, businesses lose revenue, create data inconsistencies, and violate compliance requirements.

Kapsel provides the missing reliability layer: guaranteed webhook delivery with cryptographic proof. We eliminate the gap between webhook generation and successful processing through intelligent retry logic, failure isolation, and complete audit trails.
