# Kapsel Implementation Roadmap

## Current State Assessment

### Ground Truth vs Documentation

After comprehensive codebase review, here's the honest state:

**What Works:**

- Webhook ingestion endpoint (`/ingest/:endpoint_id`)
- PostgreSQL persistence with idempotency
- Test infrastructure (TestEnv, MockServer, TestClock)
- Domain models and error taxonomy
- Basic worker pool structure
- HTTP delivery client (COMPLETE - confirmed via TDD tests)
- Delivery attempt persistence (COMPLETE - implemented)

**What's Missing:**

- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Circuit breaker integration
- Performance benchmarks (using mock data)
- Management API endpoints
- Metrics and monitoring

**Technical Debt:**

- Mock memory_usage() in benchmarks
- Database connection pool exhaustion during parallel tests

### Test Coverage Analysis

Current test distribution:

- Unit tests: ~20 tests (crate-level)
- Integration tests: ~35 tests
- Property tests: ~5 test properties
- End-to-end tests: ~7 tests

**Coverage Gaps:**

- No delivery client tests (doesn't exist yet)
- No circuit breaker integration tests
- No load/stress tests
- No chaos/failure injection tests
- No deterministic simulation tests

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Exponential Backoff & Circuit Breaker Integration (Week 1)

**Objective:** Complete webhook reliability with retry logic and failure isolation

**Status Update:** HTTP delivery client is COMPLETE and fully functional. TDD test suite confirms:

- Successful webhook delivery
- Connection timeout handling
- HTTP error response processing
- Rate limiting with Retry-After headers
- Connection refused handling
- Request validation and duration tracking
- Large response body handling with truncation

#### Day 1-2: Exponential Backoff Implementation (TDD)

#### Day 1-2: Exponential Backoff Implementation

**Red Phase - Property tests:**

```rust
proptest! {
    fn backoff_increases_exponentially(attempt in 0u32..20)
    fn jitter_prevents_thundering_herd(seed in any::<u64>())
    fn respects_maximum_delay(attempt in 0u32..100)
}
```

**Green Phase - Core algorithm:**

- Base delay calculation (2^attempt \* base_delay)
- Jitter addition (±25% randomization)
- Maximum delay cap (1 hour)

**Refactor Phase - Configuration:**

- Per-endpoint backoff policies
- Configurable base delay and multiplier
- Smart retry scheduling

#### Day 3: Circuit Breaker Integration Tests

**Red Phase - Integration tests:**

```rust
#[tokio::test]
async fn worker_respects_open_circuit()
#[tokio::test]
async fn worker_probes_half_open_circuit()
async fn circuit_opens_after_failure_threshold()
```

### Phase 2: Production Operations (Days 4-7)

**Objective:** Add essential production features for deployment readiness

#### Day 4: Metrics & Monitoring

**Metrics to implement:**

- webhook_ingestion_total (counter)
- webhook_delivery_attempts_total (counter)
- webhook_delivery_duration_seconds (histogram)
- circuit_breaker_state (gauge)
- worker_pool_size (gauge)

**Health checks:**

- /health - Basic liveness
- /ready - Database connectivity
- /metrics - Prometheus endpoint

#### Day 5: Rate Limiting

**Per-tenant limits:**

- Ingestion rate limiting
- Delivery concurrency limits
- Burst allowances

**Implementation:**

- Token bucket algorithm
- Redis-backed distributed limiting
- Graceful degradation

#### Days 6-7: Load Testing & Benchmarks

**Test scenarios:**

- 10K webhooks/sec ingestion
- 1K concurrent deliveries
- Circuit breaker under load
- Database connection saturation
- Memory growth over time

**Tools:**

- k6 for load generation
- pprof for profiling
- flamegraph for bottlenecks

## Test-Driven Development Process

### TDD Workflow for Each Feature

1. **RED - Write Failing Test**
   - Define expected behavior
   - Write minimal test that fails
   - Verify test fails for right reason

2. **GREEN - Make Test Pass**
   - Write simplest code that passes
   - Don't optimize prematurely
   - Focus on correctness

3. **REFACTOR - Improve Code**
   - Remove duplication
   - Improve naming
   - Add documentation
   - Optimize if needed

### Test Pyramid Target

```
         /\
        /  \  5% - E2E Tests (Full system)
       /    \
      /------\  10% - Integration Tests (With database)
     /        \
    /----------\  15% - Scenario Tests (Multi-step)
   /            \
  /--------------\  25% - Property Tests (Invariants)
 /                \
/------------------\  45% - Unit Tests (Pure functions)
```

### Testing Standards

**Unit Tests:**

- No I/O operations
- No side effects
- Fast (<1ms each)
- Test single responsibility

**Integration Tests:**

- Use TestEnv infrastructure
- Real database operations
- Mock external services
- Test component boundaries

**Property Tests:**

- Generate edge cases
- Verify invariants
- 100+ cases in CI
- Regression prevention

**Scenario Tests:**

- Multi-step workflows
- Deterministic time (TestClock)
- State transitions
- Happy and sad paths

## Success Metrics

### Week 1 Goals

- [x] ✅ 100% test coverage on delivery path
- [x] ✅ Successful webhook delivery in tests

- [ ] Prometheus metrics exposed
- [ ] Load tests passing

### Month 1 Goals

- [ ] Production deployment
- [ ] First customer webhook delivered
- [ ] 99.9% delivery rate achieved

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

- **Database bottleneck**: Use read replicas, connection pooling
- **Memory leaks**: Continuous profiling, bounded queues
- **Thundering herd**: Jitter in retry timing
- **Circuit breaker floods**: Gradual recovery in half-open

### Operational Risks

- **No monitoring**: Deploy metrics day 1
- **No rate limiting**: Basic limits before production
- **No runbooks**: Document common issues
- **No backup**: Database replication setup

## Conclusion

Kapsel has a solid foundation but needs focused execution to complete the delivery engine. The 2-week timeline is aggressive but achievable with disciplined TDD approach and clear priorities.

**Critical Path:**

1. ~~HTTP client~~ ✅ COMPLETE
2. Retry logic (2 days)
3. Circuit breaker (2 days)
4. Operations (3 days)
5. Testing/Polish (1 day)

The test-first approach ensures we build exactly what's needed with confidence in correctness. Each feature will be proven through tests before implementation, reducing debugging time and increasing velocity.

**Major Discovery:** HTTP client is already complete and fully functional! This accelerates our timeline significantly.

Next step: Begin exponential backoff TDD cycle immediately.
