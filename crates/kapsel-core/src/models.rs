//! Domain models for Kapsel webhook reliability service.
//!
//! This module defines the core domain entities used throughout the system.
//! All models follow Domain-Driven Design principles with clear boundaries
//! and explicit state transitions.
//!
//! # Key Concepts
//!
//! - **Event**: An incoming webhook that needs reliable delivery
//! - **Endpoint**: A configured destination for webhook delivery
//! - **Delivery Attempt**: A record of each delivery attempt with full audit
//!   trail
//!
//! # Type Safety
//!
//! We use newtype wrappers for IDs to prevent mixing different identifier types
//! at compile time. This catches bugs early and makes the code
//! self-documenting.
